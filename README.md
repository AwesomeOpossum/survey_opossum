#Survey Opossum
##What is it?

Are you tired of having the survey monkey on your back?!  Are you sick of paying $4 billion dollars
per survey?! Welcome to Survey Opossum! Survey Opossum is an app that allows users
to create a survey and track survey results. The author can send out a link, and
anyone with the link can fill out the survey. Survey Opossum will help you get the
important information you need to make informed decisions.

##How to use Survey Opossum
Survey Opossum is simple to use. Authors sign-up for a free account and they will be
directed to a "My Survey's" page, where they can create new surveys, view all current surveys, and
view results for each survey. When creating a new survey, authors can add as many questions
as they'd like, and customize the survey answer format by selecting from yes/no, short answer, or
long answer options. Authors can even specify which questions they want to make
optional or required in a survey, by simply checking required. Once a new survey is submitted,
a new link called "Take Survey" will be displayed by that survey on the author's profile page, so
that the author can share the survey with the world.
